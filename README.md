# Rust bindings for Apache ADBC

> Status: abandoned due to too high packaging cost

Rust crate with bindings to pre-built libraries of Apache [Arrow Database Connectivity (ADBC)](https://arrow.apache.org/adbc/current/index.html).

Libraries are built using Nix flakes for [ADBC](https://github.com/aljazerzen/arrow-adbc-nix) and [nanoarrow](https://github.com/aljazerzen/arrow-nanoarrow-nix).
